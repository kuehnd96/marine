# Diary of my journey with project Marine

### Come along as I plan, design, implement, and support software for my most ambitious side project

8/17/2021

I find myself thinking about this project a lot during the course of my days. I scribbled the high-level architecture (UI, backend API, persisted storage) and first crack at the accompanying Azure services in my notebook the other day. I also took a first swipe at dev tools, tech stack, and the environments I think I will need. In the coming days I plan to hash out security, authentication, and logging. I will have to try and carve out more time to work on this since I am having trouble not thinking about it.
