# Diary of my journey with project Marine

### Come along as I plan, design, implement, and support software for my most ambitious side project yet

3/8/2022

Hello. Well, my job search ended in January and I am now enjoying my new job. This job search was the higher priority that forced me to put this side project aside. While I am just over a month into my new job I still have to keep this side project on the back burner. I have a small side project and a big one to tackle before I get back to this one. I still plan to see this project through down the road a bit. I will return to this.

Happy Halloween for those of you in the United States. I have not worked on this side project since early September. The reason is something big has snatched my attention that is a higher priority than this side project. I won't get into details of what that is at this time. I will get back to this project as soon as I can. I have been thinking about the design of this project here and there and I am still excited about it. Stay tuned.

I have done little to nothing on this project since my last entry in this diary. I had 5 days off for Labor Day weekend and I took a break from screens for the whole time. I love computers and coding but I need a break from them from them at rare times. These days I only have a little time each week to work on this side project but I am determined to keep the momentum going.

I have created my milestones, planned my environments, and I have a growing list of high-level issues that need to be broken down and entered into GitHub. I am wearing my project manager hat this Saturday night.

I have hashed out my approach to authentication; I am going to use an OpenID Connect authorization code flow for the authentication of this application. Thanks to a talk on modern authentication I gave late last year this was a relatively easy decision. I am going to use Auth0 for this authentication. Nothing against Okta but I used Auth0 for a client last year and I am going the more familiar route for this part of the project. (I am awaire that Okta now owns Auth0.)

A diagram for the authentication flow and the high-level architecture I mentioned in the previous entry below are on their way. My highest priority is getting all of my todo's into GitHub issues on this repo ASAP. I have not used GitHub issues yet to track work so it will be a fun new experience. This side project is often thought of but I need to get more of my designs into diagrams and documents in this repo to share with others.

I find myself thinking about this project a lot during the course of my day. I scribbled the high-level architecture (UI, backend API, persisted storage) and first crack at the accompanying Azure services in my notebook the other day. I also took a first swipe at dev tools, tech stack, and the environments I think I will need. In the coming days I plan to hash out security, authentication, and logging. I will have to try and carve out more time to work on this since I am having trouble not thinking about it.
