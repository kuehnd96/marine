# Diary of my journey with project Marine

### Come along as I plan, design, implement, and support software for my most ambitious side project yet

8/28/2021

I have created my milestones, planned my environments, and I have a growing list of high-level issues that need to be broken down and entered into GitHub. I am wearing my project manager hat this Saturday night.

I have hashed out my approach to authentication; I am going to use an OpenID Connect authorization code flow for the authentication of this application. Thanks to a talk on modern authentication I gave late last year this was a relatively easy decision. I am going to use Auth0 for this authentication. Nothing against Okta but I used Auth0 for a client last year and I am going the more familiar route for this part of the project. (I am awaire that Okta now owns Auth0.)

A diagram for the authentication flow and the high-level architecture I mentioned in the previous entry below are on their way. My highest priority is getting all of my todo's into GitHub issues on this repo ASAP. I have not used GitHub issues yet to track work so it will be a fun new experience. This side project is often thought of but I need to get more of my designs into diagrams and documents in this repo to share with others.

I find myself thinking about this project a lot during the course of my day. I scribbled the high-level architecture (UI, backend API, persisted storage) and first crack at the accompanying Azure services in my notebook the other day. I also took a first swipe at dev tools, tech stack, and the environments I think I will need. In the coming days I plan to hash out security, authentication, and logging. I will have to try and carve out more time to work on this since I am having trouble not thinking about it.
