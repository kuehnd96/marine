# Marine (code name)

Follow my journey with this [developer diary](https://github.com/kuehnd96/marine/blob/main/Diary.md)

## Genesis

I like to track a lot of data when I take on a job search (companies, opportunities, recruiters). This data helps me in future job searches. I have been keeping track of my job searches using an Excel spreadsheet since I started tracking this data. As the breadth of data that I wanted to track grew it occurred to me that I could create software to tracking this data much more efficiently than using Excel.

## Goal

The ultimate goal of this side project is to produce something that not only I can use to track finding a new career opportunity, but others can use, too. I want to take this from idea all the way to minimum viable product and beyond. I am as excited about the work that comes before I write my first line of code as I am about the work that comes after. I am looking to flex and build my architectural, project management, and tech lead muscles with this project.

## Name

I am working on a name for this. I have a few options but a code name will do until I make a final decision. The code name comes from [Starcraft II](https://starcraft2.com/en-us/). The code names for all of my side projects are Terran units.

## Technologies

Right now I plan to use .NET 6, Web API, and .NET MAUI for the main tech stack of this project. Recently I had the idea of creating a web UI for this using TypeScript (React/Vue/Angular); I'll get to that some day.
